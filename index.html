      <p>I understand this can seem barebones, but I can promise that I am working on improving this website as I learn more about programming.
        I will also make this as one of my personal blog including my old favorite flash games; I understand that eventually flash player will be outdated
        but I have a plan to remake some of my old favorite flash games soon!</p>
