    <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Abel S. Medina and I am very interested in techonology. I can be considered
      over optimistic with techonology but that is only because I enjoy every aspect of it. I am currently
    at NMSU majoring in IET (Information Engineering techonologies) and I am very interested in penetration testing.</p>

      <p>I also have side projects that I hope to accomplish one of these days. I am currently working on a 8 bit CPU
      with the help of Ben Eater but I hope to make more useful components with this knowledge in the future. I am also
     working on developing a game. Although development has been slow, I have been gathering knowledge on C, Java, front-end web developement,
   and Python. More Info on these projects can be found on my <a href="projects.html">projects</a> page</p>
