    <h2 id="update2" class="glow-rusty-red">Education</h2>
    <p>I am currently a full-time student at NMSU (New Mexico State University) and I expect to
    graduate in may of 2023. Before attending NMSU, I graduated from Santa Fe High School in Santa
    Fe New Mexico as class of 2019.</p>

    <h2 id="update1" class="glow-rusty-red">Relevant Courses & Experience</h2>
    <p>At NMSU (New Mexico State University), I have taken all of my ET 100 and 200 level courses
    along with my CS 100 and 200 level courses. As of today, I am currently taking my ET 300 and CS 300
    level courses. The course map for my current major, IET (Information Engineering Techonologies), can
    be seen on on NMSU's webpage <a href="https://catalogs.nmsu.edu/nmsu/engineering/engineering-technology-surveying/engineering-technology-information-bachelor-science-engineering-technology/#roadmaptext">here</a>
    </p>

    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy to learn a lot about mechatronics, which can be seen under my projects tab
    with regards to my 8-Bit CPU project. I have learned a lot about mechatronics from Ben Eater and continue to
    do so with various other tutors in the world of computers. I also enjoy to learn new programming techniques and
    principles in the following languages: C, C++, Java, Python, Website backend development, and shell scripting. I
    will eventually include my projects involving those various programming langauges in my projects tab as I continue
    to work hard in development.</p>

    <h2 id="update3" class="glow-rusty-red">Career Related Expierences</h2>
    <p>I have joined plenty of CTF (capture the flag) challenges in the past with <a href="https://angstromctf.com/">Angstrom</a>.
    I have participated in Angstrom CTFs from 2017 to 2019 and when entering NMSU, I began to attend the on campus google CTF challenges.
    After having experience in CTFs, at NMSU I joined a club called NSG (Network Security Group) and had the oppurtunity to learn more about
    the cyber security field of computer science. The majority of challenges I participated while in NSG where all hosted on a website called
    <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/">HackTheBox</a>.</p>
