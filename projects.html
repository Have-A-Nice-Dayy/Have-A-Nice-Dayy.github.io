    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>I am currently working on making an 8 bit CPU. After I took an ET 182 course at NMSU, I felt motivation
    to keep working on mechatronics. I looked up a lot of in depth guides on how CPU's work, on my search I found
    a man by the name of <strong>Ben Eater</strong> who focuses a lot on mechatronics. <strong>Ben Eater</strong> talks
    a lot about the work from <strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a></strong>. I
    find mechatronics very interesting so I took on the challenge of creating an 8 bit CPU based off of <strong>Ben Eater's</strong> 8 bit CPU.</p>

    <p>Until I learn to add submenus to the navbar I will have submenus within the project page in a unordered list below.</p>
