    <h2>The start</h2>
    <p>I began by getting inspiration and basic knowledge of mechatronics from my NMSU ET 182 course. Once
    I had my basics down I immiedietly threw myself into the very advanced portion of mechatronics, which
    was very confusing but I was able to learn about each chip I used. <strong>Ben Eater</strong> is very
    well known for writing thorough guides as well as explaining techonology step by step. I followed the
    guide that was involving the 8 bit CPU and below I made a table with the chips I used for a specific module.
    <br><br><b>Note that each chip will have a link to the datasheet for more specific information!</b></p>

    <em>Figure 1 - Clock Module</em>

    <p>In order to make a CPU, you need a clock and this module allows you to choose between a
    <b>monostable</b> clock or a <b>astable</b> clock with the a <b>bistable</b> circuit controlling
    the switch between the two types of clocks. The definition of a <b>bistable</b> circuit is that it
    is either on or it is off so, the state is stable. The definition of a <b>astable</b> circuit is that
    the state on or off is unstable; constantly switching between both on and off states. A <b>monostable</b>
    circuit means that when pressed it turns on but when let go it turns off, so the state is only on and stable
    depending on how long you trigger its state. <br><br>Below I will post a video of my clock module in action.</p>

    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S-I7iEo5CSE" width="420" height="315" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <p>In the video the red light indicates you have entered <b>monostable</b> mode which I refer to as manual mode because
    it allows me to manually advance the clock one cycle. The green light indicates <b>astable</b> mode which means the clocks
    advances on its own at the set frequency. <br><br>Below I will post an image of the schematic for the clock module. <b>This
    schematic was made by Ben Eater and I have yet to make my own schematic for the one I designed.</b></p>
