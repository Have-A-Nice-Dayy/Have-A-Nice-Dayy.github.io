    <h2 class="glow-rusty-red">The purpose of this website</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to show my projects and what I am currently up to. I also plan on adding plenty
    of features in the near feature. This website will definitely change and develop into a more comforting place to visit
    as well as acting as a portfolio!</p>

    <h2 class="glow-rusty-red">About me</h2>
    <p>I grew up constantly playing outside but it wasn't until this game called <em>Minecraft</em> came out on mobile devices that
    my interest moved over to the better version at the time known as <em>Minecraft</em> <em><b>Java Edition</b></em>. Once I started going to my windows vista pc
    I learned to navigate the filesystem via file explorer and steadily I became better at using PC's including macs. After a few years I learned
    to install operating systems and partition HDDs/SSDs. I learned a lot about computers and my interest since the first day I booted a computer has
    always been the same. I hope to contribute to the world of techonology one day and I will strive to learn as much about it as I can.</p>
